#Sometimes, particularly in scripts which will perform some sort of analysis or processing on images, you may wish to capture smaller images than the current resolution of the camera. Although such resizing can be performed using libraries like PIL or OpenCV, it is considerably more efficient to have the Pi’s GPU perform the resizing when capturing the image. This can be done with the resize parameter of the capture() methods:
#The resize parameter can also be specified when recording video with the start_recording() method.

    camera.resolution = (1280, 720)
    camera.framerate = 30
    #camera.start_preview()

    # Wait for analog gain to settle on a higher value than 1
    while camera.analog_gain <= 1:
        time.sleep(0.1)
    # Now fix the values
    camera.shutter_speed = camera.exposure_speed
    camera.exposure_mode = 'off'
    g = camera.awb_gains
    camera.awb_mode = 'off'
    camera.awb_gains = g
    # Finally, take several photos with the fixed settings
    camera.capture_sequence(['image%02d.jpg' % i for i in range(10)])

#framerate
    #Retrieves or sets the framerate at which video-port based image captures, video recordings, and previews will run.
    #When queried, the framerate property returns the rate at which the camera’s video and preview ports will operate as a Fraction instance which can be easily converted to an int or float.
    #When set, the property reconfigures the camera so that the next call to recording and previewing methods will use the new framerate. The framerate can be specified as an int, float, Fraction, or a (numerator, denominator) tuple. The camera must not be closed, and no recording must be active when the property is set.
    #The initial value of this property can be specified with the framerate parameter in the PiCamera constructor.
#analog_gain
    #Retrieves the current analog gain of the camera.When queried, this property returns the analog gain currently being used by the camera. The value represents the analog gain of the sensor prior to digital conversion. The value is returned as a Fraction instance.
#shutter_speed (0 is auto)
    #Retrieves or sets the shutter speed of the camera in microseconds.When queried, the shutter_speed property returns the shutter speed of the camera in microseconds, or 0 which indicates that the speed will be automatically determined by the auto-exposure algorithm. Faster shutter times naturally require greater amounts of illumination and vice versa.When set, the property adjusts the shutter speed of the camera, which most obviously affects the illumination of subsequently captured images. Shutter speed can be adjusted while previews or recordings are running. The default value is 0 (auto).
#exposure_speed
    #Retrieves the current shutter speed of the camera.When queried, this property returns the shutter speed currently being used by the camera. If you have set shutter_speed to a non-zero value, then exposure_speed and shutter_speed should be equal. However, if shutter_speed is set to 0 (auto), then you can read the actual shutter speed being used from this attribute. The value is returned as an integer representing a number of microseconds. This is a read-only property.
#exposure_mode      情景模式
    #Retrieves or sets the exposure mode of the camera.When queried, the exposure_mode property returns a string representing the exposure setting of the camera. The possible values can be obtained from the PiCamera.EXPOSURE_MODES attribute, and are as follows:'off''auto''night''nightpreview''backlight''spotlight''sports''snow''beach''verylong''fixedfs''antishake''fireworks'
#awb_gains   白平衡
    #Gets or sets the auto-white-balance gains of the camera.When queried, this attribute returns a tuple of values representing the (red, blue) balance of the camera. The red and blue values are returned Fraction instances. The values will be between 0.0 and 8.0.When set, this attribute adjusts the camera’s auto-white-balance gains. The property can be specified as a single value in which case both red and blue gains will be adjusted equally, or as a (red, blue) tuple. Values can be specified as an int, float or Fraction and each gain must be between 0.0 and 8.0. Typical values for the gains are between 0.9 and 1.9. The property can be set while recordings or previews are in progress.
#awb_mode   白平衡模式
    #Retrieves or sets the auto-white-balance mode of the camera.When queried, the awb_mode property returns a string representing the auto white balance setting of the camera. The possible values can be obtained from the PiCamera.AWB_MODES attribute, and are as follows:'off''auto''sunlight''cloudy''shade''tungsten''fluorescent''incandescent''flash''horizon'
    #When set, the property adjusts the camera’s auto-white-balance mode. The property can be set while recordings or previews are in progress. The default value is 'auto'.

> Capturing to a network stream

This is a variation of Capturing timelapse sequences. Here we have two scripts: a server (presumably on a fast machine) which listens for a connection from the Raspberry Pi, and a client which runs on the Raspberry Pi and sends a continual stream of images to the server. We’ll use a very simple protocol for communication: first the length of the image will be sent as a 32-bit integer (in Little Endian format), then this will be followed by the bytes of image data. If the length is 0, this indicates that the connection should be closed as no more images will be forthcoming. This protocol is illustrated below:
- - - 
| image length  |  image data   | image length  |  image data   |  image length  |  
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |  :-----------: |  
|  32bit        |  68702bytes   |      32bit    |  87532bytes   |  32bit(4bytes) |  
Firstly the `server` script (which relies on PIL for reading JPEGs, but you could replace this with any other suitable graphics library, e.g. OpenCV or GraphicsMagick):
- - -
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import io
import socket
import struct
from PIL import Image

# Start a socket listening for connections on 0.0.0.0:8000 (0.0.0.0 means
# all interfaces)
server_socket = socket.socket()
server_socket.bind(('0.0.0.0', 8000))
server_socket.listen(0)

# Accept a single connection and make a file-like object out of it
connection = server_socket.accept()[0].makefile('rb')
try:
    while True:
        # Read the length of the image as a 32-bit unsigned int. If the
        # length is zero, quit the loop
        image_len = struct.unpack('<L', connection.read(struct.calcsize('<L')))[0]
        if not image_len:
            break
        # Construct a stream to hold the image data and read the image
        # data from the connection
        image_stream = io.BytesIO()
        image_stream.write(connection.read(image_len))
        # Rewind the stream, open it as an image with PIL and do some
        # processing on it
        image_stream.seek(0)
        image = Image.open(image_stream)
        print('Image is %dx%d' % image.size)
        image.verify()
        print('Image is verified')
finally:
    connection.close()
    server_socket.close()
```

Now for the `client` side of things, on the Raspberry Pi:  

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import io
import socket
import struct
import time
import picamera

# Connect a client socket to my_server:8000 (change my_server to the
# hostname of your server)
client_socket = socket.socket()
client_socket.connect(('220.69.240.4', 8000))

# Make a file-like object out of the connection
connection = client_socket.makefile('wb')
try:
    with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
        camera.resolution = (640, 480)
        # Start a preview and let the camera warm up for 2 seconds
        camera.start_preview()
        time.sleep(2)

        # Note the start time and construct a stream to hold image data
        # temporarily (we could write it directly to connection but in this
        # case we want to find out the size of each capture first to keep
        # our protocol simple)
        start = time.time()
        stream = io.BytesIO()
        for foo in camera.capture_continuous(stream, 'jpeg'):
            # Write the length of the capture to the stream and flush to
            # ensure it actually gets sent
            connection.write(struct.pack('<L', stream.tell()))
            connection.flush()
            # Rewind the stream and send the image data over the wire
            stream.seek(0)
            connection.write(stream.read())
            # If we've been capturing for more than 30 seconds, quit
            if time.time() - start > 30:
                break
            # Reset the stream for the next capture
            stream.seek(0)
            stream.truncate()
    # Write a length of zero to the stream to signal we're done
    connection.write(struct.pack('<L', 0))
finally:
    connection.close()
    client_socket.close()

> Recording video to a file

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import picamera

with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.resolution = (640, 480)
    camera.start_recording('my_video.h264')
    print('start')
    camera.wait_recording(7) 
    #take a 7second video
    camera.stop_recording()

#Note that we use wait_recording() in the example above instead of time.sleep() which we’ve been using in the image capture recipes above. The wait_recording() method is similar in that it will pause for the number of seconds specified, but unlike time.sleep() it will continually check for recording errors (e.g. an out of disk space condition) while it is waiting. If we had used time.sleep() instead, such errors would only be raised by the stop_recording() call (which could be long after the error actually occurred).

> Recording video to a stream

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import io
import picamera

stream = io.BytesIO()
with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.resolution = (640, 480)
    #size of the video
    camera.start_recording(stream, format='h264', quality=23)
    # stream is the output
    #format h264,mjpeg,yuv,rgb,rgba,bgr,bgra
    #quality is between 1 (highest quality) and 40 (lowest quality)
    camera.wait_recording(15)
    # take a 15seconds video
    camera.stop_recording()

#Here, we’ve set the quality parameter to indicate to the encoder the level of image quality that we’d like it to try and maintain. The camera’s H.264 encoder is primarily constrained by two parameters:

#bitrate limits the encoder’s output to a certain number of bits per second. The default is 17000000 (17Mbps), and the maximum value is 25000000 (25Mbps). Higher values give the encoder more “freedom” to encode at higher qualities. You will likely find that the default doesn’t constrain the encoder at all except at higher recording resolutions.

#quality tells the encoder what level of image quality to maintain. Values can be between 1 (highest quality) and 40 (lowest quality), with typical values providing a reasonable trade-off between bandwidth and quality being between 20 and 25.

#As well as using stream classes built into Python (like BytesIO) you can also construct your own custom outputs. This is particularly useful for video recording, as discussed in the linked recipe.
